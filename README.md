## How to get our scripts

- It's necessary to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org) installed
- Open a git bash and run the command 
    ``` 
    git clone https://gitlab.com/Yairama/pyminerpit.git
    ```



## Done Things

### Floating Cone Algorithm
_Using floating cone:_

The cone's data can be changed in the Datalog.csv/txt you can change the format in the code.
To run the scrip just open a cmd in the floating_cone folder and run the command `python floating_cone.py` and you will se the results in the console.

### Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest route
_Using Algorithm Dijkstra script:_

For use this script you can change three parts important to execute the code:
  1. Data_Dijkstra.csv/txt (review data)
  2. Define Origen of route (change in the code)
  3. Define Final of route(change in the code)
To run the scrip just open a cmd in the dijkstra_pit folder and run the command `python Algorithm_Dijkstra.py` and you will se the results of route in the console.
     
This script is base for create new algorithms or improve other like:Open pit limit optimization using dijkstra’s algorithm

### Open pit limit optimization using dijkstra’s algorithm
_Using dijkstra's script:_

The cone's data can be changed in the Datalog.csv/txt you can change the format in the code. 
To run the scrip just open a cmd in the dijkstra_pit folder and run the command `python dijkstra_pit.py` and you will se the results in the console.
- This algorithm has been extracted from the following paper: [Open pit limit optimization using dijkstra’s algorithm](https://ijmge.ut.ac.ir/article_75161_73cf9766e88e3e69c2b09d8707eeb612.pdf)
- This algorithm has the same results as Lerch & Grossman's algorithm, but has better performance (We recommend read the paper's results)
